It also has off-street parking if you're driving, and access to a charming backyard area for relaxing.\n\nEntrance:\nCheck-in is easy, because the door is secured with an entrance code that is not reused.  No keys to get or return!  We send you your code and you can enter at any time day or night without arranging a time for us to give you keys.\n\nPrivacy:\nThis is a 100% private, detached unit.\n\nParking and Driving:\nThere is free parking available on 30th Avenue or on Dewey behind the unit.\n\n520 is about 5 minutes away, giving you very quick access to either I5 or the East Side.\n\nTransportation:\nThere is a ZipCar at 24th and Madison.  There are usually Car2Go cars on Madison near by.\n\nThe bus stop is at E Madison St & 28th Ave E, less than a five minute walk away.  Downtown is about ten minutes on the 11 bus.  The 8 bus provides quick access to Seattle Center, Capitol Hill, Rainier Valley, and the Mount Baker Link station.\n\nInternet:\nFree internet of course.  We *don't* currently have a TV in the unit.\n\nFine Dining:\nMadison Valley has some of Seattle's best dining.

Since you're in our backyard, we're around in case you need any assistance.\n\nHealth & Fitness:\nLila Yoga (29th and Madison) is a fantastic yoga studio.  Kate's Day Spa (2713 E. Madison Street) is an excellent place to relax, and is open on weekends.  Seattle Shambhala Center is a Buddhist Temple and is located two blocks down.  It has an Open House (good for beginners) every Thursday evening.\n\nArboretum:\nThe best thing about this neighborhood is the Arboretum.  You're less than five minutes away -- just cross Madison.  Arboretum highlights include hiking, canoeing and kayaking, picnics, a full soccer court, and enjoying the year-round collection of magnificent flowers, plants and trees. The Arboretum also houses the Seattle Japanese Garden, open from February to November, a 3 1/2 acre formal garden. It features a lake with koi and turtles, community room rentals, tea ceremonies and special events all year round.  At the north end of the park is Foster Island, which is an amazing and peaceful place to visit, with pedestrian trails that connect the island to the mainland.\n\nMadison Park:\nMadison Park is within walking distance, although a longer walk than some may want to take.

The location was fantastic - close to great restaurants and bakeries, within walking distance to Washington Park Arboretum, and on a super quiet street with plenty of free parking. We didn't have a need to go downtown, but if we had the house was a 5 minute walk from a bus stop. The Guest House was stocked with everything we needed including an iron and a blow dryer. The king sized bed was very comfy, and there wasn't anything we lacked. Btw, take note there is no tv, which was a plus in my book.

The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the king setup on arrival. The unit is quite compact so note that there are no hanging closets, just drawers. Provision of some toiletries (even unscented shave cream!) and a hair dryer was thoughtful. The unit was clean and except for note 1 (below) well-lighted. Heat control was excellent and ventilation through the sliding windows was fine. Parking on the street, no problem (careful you don't park in the drive and get blocked in by the neighbors' car). Good eateries a couple of blocks away on Madison (especially good breakfast at the bistro on the corner of Madison and E Washington Lake). \r\nCouple of issues:\r\n1. The bed lamp mounted on the shelf unit upright doesn't have a power switch (that we could find). The light was on when we arrived but to turn it off meant pulling the bed away from the wall far enough to reach behind the headboard and unplug the lamp cord, neither safe nor convenient.\r\n2. While we were grateful for the coffeemaker and just enough grounds for some morning java there were no cups in the cupboard. We enjoyed (slurped) our coffee using the two cereal bowls a la the style of France. \r\n3. The box of plastic bin liners was empty so we used the bathroom bin (which hadn't been emptied after the previous guests). \r\nThese inconveniences were minor compared to our overall positive experience. It was a typical rainy autumn Seattle day so we didn't get a chance to enjoy the secluded patio in front of the unit...maybe next time.

The private keyless entrance is very convenient. It has everything you need for a comfortable stay in a quiet neighborhood that feels very safe. The free wifi is very useful. There are so many little details that I loved- scented candles, cereal in the cupboard, wine glasses, a first aid kit in the bathroom, 2 types of shampoo and conditioner, a Seattle tourist guide, bus schedules, a fridge and freezer, etc. The bed is not too soft nor too hard. So many options for lighting- there were overhead lights, a reading light, lights in the kitchen, etc. It was tidy and well put together- Julius has great taste in decor and furniture, I must say :) I felt very welcomed and really enjoyed my stay.
